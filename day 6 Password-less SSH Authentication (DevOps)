## Day 7 – Password-less SSH Authentication (DevOps)

### Task Overview
The system administration team requires automation scripts on the jumphost to run on all application servers without manual intervention.  
To achieve this, password-less SSH authentication must be configured from user `thor` on the jumphost to all app servers using their respective sudo users.

---

## Step 1: Verify Current User
```bash
whoami

Explanation:

Confirms the currently logged-in user.

Ensures we are operating as thor, as SSH keys are user-specific.

Output:
thor

Step 2: Generate SSH Key Pair
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048

Explanation:

ssh-keygen → Creates an SSH key pair.

-t rsa → Specifies RSA encryption algorithm.

-b 2048 → Sets key strength to 2048 bits (secure and widely used).

Creates two files:

~/.ssh/id_rsa → Private key (never shared).

~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub → Public key (shared with remote servers).

Note:

Press Enter for default file location.

Leave passphrase empty for automation compatibility.

Step 3: Copy Public Key to App Server 1
ssh-copy-id tony@stapp01

Explanation:

Copies the public key (id_rsa.pub) to the remote server.

Appends it to:

/home/tony/.ssh/authorized_keys


Enables password-less login for future SSH connections.

Step 4: Copy Public Key to App Server 2
ssh-copy-id steve@stapp02

Explanation:

Same process as above.

Enables thor to SSH into stapp02 as steve without password.

Step 5: Copy Public Key to App Server 3
ssh-copy-id banner@stapp03

Explanation:

Completes SSH trust setup for all application servers.

Step 6: Validate Password-less SSH Login
ssh tony@stapp01
ssh steve@stapp02
ssh banner@stapp03

Expected Result:

Login should succeed without asking for a password.

Key File Locations
On Jumphost:
/home/thor/.ssh/id_rsa      → Private key
/home/thor/.ssh/id_rsa.pub  → Public key

On App Servers:
/home/<user>/.ssh/authorized_keys

Real-World Use Case

Password-less SSH authentication is a foundational DevOps practice used for:

Running automation scripts across multiple servers

Configuration management tools (Ansible, Chef, Puppet)

CI/CD pipelines

Scheduled cron jobs

Secure access without sharing passwords

This setup ensures security, scalability, and automation readiness in production environments.
Summary

SSH key-based authentication was successfully configured.

Automation scripts can now access all app servers securely.

No passwords are required for future SSH connections
