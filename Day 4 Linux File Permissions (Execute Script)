# Day 4 – Linux File Permissions (Execute Script)

## 📌 Task Overview

In the xFusionCorp Industries Nautilus project, the sysadmin team deployed a backup automation script named **`xfusioncorp.sh`** across servers. On **App Server 2**, the script existed but had **no permissions at all**, making it unusable.

My task was to:

* Fix the file permissions
* Ensure **all users** can execute the script

---

## 🖥️ Server Details

* **Server Name:** App Server 2
* **Hostname:** `stapp02`
* **File Path:** `/tmp/xfusioncorp.sh`

---

## 🔍 Initial Issue

When checking the file permissions:

```bash
ls -l /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh
```

Output:

```
---------- 1 root root 40 Dec 14 13:04 /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh
```

### ❌ Problem Identified

* No read, write, or execute permissions
* Even **root** could not execute the script
* Automation and backups would fail

---

## 🛠️ Solution Applied

To ensure the script is executable by **all users**, I ran:

```bash
chmod 755 /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh
```

### Why `755`?

* **Owner (root):** read, write, execute
* **Group:** read, execute
* **Others:** read, execute

This meets the task requirement and aligns with real-world production practices.

## ✅ Verification

```bash
ls -l /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh
```

Expected output:

```
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 40 Dec 14 13:04 /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh
```

(Optional test)

```bash
/tmp/xfusioncorp.sh
```

## 🌍 Real-World Relevance

This task reflects common DevOps scenarios:

* Fixing broken cron jobs due to permission issues
* Deploying automation and backup scripts
* Troubleshooting CI/CD and server hardening problems

Understanding Linux permissions is critical for **reliable automation and system stability**.

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

✔️ Script permissions corrected
✔️ All users can execute the script
✔️ Backup automation restored
