# Day 5 – SELinux Installation & Permanent Disable

## 📌 Task Overview

Following a security audit, the xFusionCorp Industries security team decided to introduce **SELinux** to improve application and server security. As part of initial testing, SELinux needed to be installed but **permanently disabled** on **App Server 3** until proper policies are configured.

This task focuses on **preparing SELinux correctly without affecting runtime operations**.

---

## 🖥️ Server Details

* **Server Name:** App Server 3
* **Hostname:** `stapp03`
* **OS Type:** RHEL/CentOS-based Linux

---

## 🎯 Task Requirements

* Install required SELinux packages
* Permanently disable SELinux
* Do **NOT** reboot the server
* Ignore current SELinux runtime status
* Ensure SELinux is disabled **after the next reboot**

---

## 🛠️ Implementation Steps

### 1️⃣ Login to App Server 3

```bash
ssh steve@stapp03
```

---

### 2️⃣ Install SELinux Required Packages

```bash
yum install -y selinux-policy selinux-policy-targeted policycoreutils libselinux-utils
```

✔️ These packages are required for SELinux management and future policy configuration.

---

### 3️⃣ Permanently Disable SELinux

Edit the SELinux configuration file:

```bash
vi /etc/selinux/config
```

Update the following line:

```ini
SELINUX=disabled
```

Save and exit the file.

---

### 4️⃣ Verify Configuration

```bash
grep SELINUX= /etc/selinux/config
```

Expected output:

```ini
SELINUX=disabled
```

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

* `setenforce 0` was **not used** because it only changes runtime behavior
* No reboot was performed as per task instructions
* SELinux will be disabled **after the scheduled maintenance reboot**

---

## 🌍 Real-World DevOps Relevance

This task reflects real production practices where:

* Security tools are staged before enforcement
* Configuration changes are applied ahead of maintenance windows
* Runtime stability is preserved during audits

Understanding SELinux modes (**enforcing, permissive, disabled**) is essential for secure Linux administration.

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

✔️ SELinux packages installed successfully
✔️ SELinux permanently disabled via configuration
✔️ Server left running without reboot
